For some of the techniques covered hands-on use will be limited. Each student is required to carry out a project on his/her own protein of interest. Each participant asks a specific question about a protein and then uses the techniques covered in the course to address the question. Lectures and laboratory. Note: Students who have received credit for this topic under a CHEM 690 number may not take this course for credit." ;

This course uses machine design software to aid in the analysis and design of electrical machines, which is offered in a computer-aided design (CAD) environment. The emphasis is on the design of electrical machines for renewable energy and electric vehicle applications. Emphasis is placed on permanent-magnet and switched reluctance machines, although machines of importance, like the induction machine, are also discussed. Magnetic equivalent circuits for a magnet and a typical machine radial field geometry are developed which lead naturally to sizing equations. Other geometries and Eddy current and hysteresis core loss models are presented. The torque angle curves of the switched reluctance machine are developed, which lead to design concepts. The synchronous reluctance machine is introduced. A project is required." ;

Thus, in this course, first the concept of tensors is presented in detail as the linear transformation. This is followed by the formulation of the kinematics of very small and large deformation and the description of stresses and the basic laws of continuum mechanics common to all materials. Finally, constitutive equations governing the behaviours of idealized materials, including the elastic, hyperelastic and viscous materials, are presented as applications of these laws.

The course comprises: (1) in-class preparation meetings followed by (2) a one-week in-field experience. During this week, students meet practitioners and individuals from local communities, industries and/or governments involved in EA. Through these interactions, students are exposed to a diverse range of perspectives and experiences related to EA. The course is validated through an assessment of the knowledge acquired during the trip. Students are responsible for the cost of food, accommodation and transportation associated with the one-week field trip (cost varies depending on destination).

The course is premised on a number of questions. These include but are not limited to: What is education? How do we understand education in its moral, ethical and spiritual dimensions? What role does education play (or have the potential of playing) in personal and social transformation? What is effective teaching and how can we cultivate the courage to teach effectively?" ;

    dc:description " Meso organizational behaviour focuses on understanding organizational phenomena by bridging concepts or theories at the individual (i.e. micro) and the contextual (i.e.macro) levels of analysis. The seminar examines people within organizations by exploring different levels of analysis, including individuals, groups, departments, organizations, industries, and societies. It focuses on better understanding how similar phenomena may operate at different levels, how phenomena at any one level are shaped by phenomena at other levels, and the reciprocal dynamics that exist between levels to make up the world of organizations in which we live and work. Meso organizational behaviour is important because: (a) it helps students of human resource management better understand the systemic factors that contribute to how individuals think, feel, and act in organizations; and (b) it helps students better understand how organizations are shaped by the people that populate them.

The primary aim is to introduce students to an understanding of how organizational scholars have conceptualized and studied organizations as systems of structures and relations and as cultural systems, and how these systems interact with and are embedded in the context of an external environment. To accomplish this aim the seminar focuses on some basic sociological tools for conceptually investigating a variety of organizational topics. Students acquire an in-depth understanding of how organizations are made up of formal, relational and cultural structures both inside and outside the organizational boundary. Some topics and conceptual frameworks include power, conflict, organizational identity and image, organizational control, discourse and rhetoric, legitimacy, organizational impression management, emergence of new organizations, and organizational change." ;

    dc:description " This course adopts the interactional framework of leadership, which considers that the leadership process is a function of three components: the leader, the followers, and the context. The course is structured to cover classic and emergent theories that address each of these components; though most theories focus on one of these three components, they also inform the other components in the model, either implicitly or explicitly. Implications for the practice of leadership are addressed through class discussions. An effort is made to ensure that students do not adopt a myopic view of leadership. Rather, different perspectives on the process of leadership are presented, that make radically different assumptions. Students are therefore required to identify these assumptions and develop well-articulated arguments that either support or refute these assumptions in order to develop a sophisticated view of leadership.

Comparative corporate governance examines how institutions in different social and economic contexts influence this relationship and its consequences for the ownership, management, and strategic competitiveness of firms. In this seminar we address questions such as: How is corporate governance practised in different countries? Why are corporate governance practices similar or different across countries? Can we identify international best practices of corporate governance? To what extent are corporate governance best practices transferable across international contexts? How do different systems of corporate governance embody different economic, social, and political trade-offs among corporate stakeholders? We approach the questions from managerial, economic, legal, political, sociological and cultural perspectives. Using both conceptual and empirical studies, we also focus on a range of substantial issues, including corporate governance in family firms and in emerging market business groups.

The course is structured around three parallel streams and provides important concepts and ideas for the tool-kit of the management consultant involved in analytical as well as change implementation projects. The first stream of the course examines the consulting process, i.e. the five phases of a consulting project from entry to termination. The second stream focuses on core consulting skills, i.e. the skills required to operate and succeed as a management consultant. These skills are essential for any type of consulting engagement, whether one works as an external or internal consultant, and whether the client in a private sector, public, or non-profit organization. The third stream is a real world consulting project that students conduct in teams with a client firm in order to apply the tools and skills discussed in class.

Supervised (co-supervised) by a faculty member(s), the applied research project is carried out individually or by a group of two students, depending on the overall requirements and the extent of the project to be conducted. The project involves working on a real-life supply chain management problem provided by a company. Once the problem is defined, the students prepare an overall project management plan to tackle the problem within a given time limit. The various stages of the project involve, among others: literature review, defining data and information requirements for problem analysis, gathering data, designing the appropriate model, conducting experimental design runs and sensitivity analyses, and presenting the solution(s) with an implementation plan. The project outcome is expected to have both academic and business merit. For projects done in groups of two students, there is a significant individual evaluation component in assessing the work done by each student." ;
