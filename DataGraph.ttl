Other important thermodynamic functions such as the partition function, the partition function for large ensembles and the Sackur-Tetrode equation are examined. The course also addresses non-equilibrium thermodynamics in the linear domain. The relations describing the production of entropy in irreversible processes due to heat transfer, charge transfer, change of volume, and chemical reactions are examined.

Paradigms considered may include scientific management, human relations, cybernetics, political economy, rational decision making, cultural studies, feminism, and post-modernism. An effort is made to examine how these various approaches emerged historically in relation to shifting patterns of power, inequality, and technological change. Issues such as the nature of bureaucracy, domination and resistance, systematically distorted communication, and public relations/external communication are addressed." ;

Emphasis is placed on permanent-magnet and switched reluctance machines, although machines of importance, like the induction machine, are also discussed. Magnetic equivalent circuits for a magnet and a typical machine radial field geometry are developed which lead naturally to sizing equations. Other geometries and Eddy current and hysteresis core loss models are presented. The torque angle curves of the switched reluctance machine are developed, which lead to design concepts. The synchronous reluctance machine is introduced. A project is required." ;

In teams, students develop a business project proposal focusing on a problem or issue faced by the organization they have chosen. Students are then expected to gather data and develop innovative and practical responses to the complex, cross-disciplinary issues faced by their client organization. Student teams are required to present a comprehensive set of recommendations to a panel comprised of faculty members, EMBA peers and representatives of the client organization. The key deliverable of this course is the actual set of recommendations and implementation plan designed to address the selected problem or issue." ;

It is divided into three sections: 1) approximately 20 literary texts; 2) approximately 20 theoretical/methodological texts; 3) approximately 20 texts drawn from adjacent and/or ancillary fields. By “text,” it means the number of poems or articles deemed by field specialists as sufficiently representative of an author's work or period.

Thus, in this course, first the concept of tensors is presented in detail as the linear transformation. This is followed by the formulation of the kinematics of very small and large deformation and the description of stresses and the basic laws of continuum mechanics common to all materials. Finally, constitutive equations governing the behaviours of idealized materials, including the elastic, hyperelastic and viscous materials, are presented as applications of these laws.

    dc:description " This course is a forum for common inquiry and reflection upon issues that have deep significance for our lives as human beings, students, and educators. Some emphasis is placed on gaining an understanding of historically significant philosophical positions and their application to problems of teaching and education. However, the primary focus is on cultivating a desire and commitment to engage in philosophical thinking as it applies to matters of concern to teachers and teaching. The course is premised on a number of questions. These include but are not limited to: What is education? How do we understand education in its moral, ethical and spiritual dimensions? What role does education play (or have the potential of playing) in personal and social transformation? What is effective teaching and how can we cultivate the courage to teach effectively?" ;

The first purpose is to review studies of education which utilize anthropological concepts and/or methods. The second purpose is to examine the three principal foci of qualitative research in the area: a. schools and their relations with the socio-cultural milieu in which they exist; b. the description and analysis of classroom processes; c. the study of individual pupils and educators. The third purpose is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of studies focusing on these areas. This includes describing and discussing some of the systematic methodological biases apparent in the literature and suggesting directions for future research." ;

The seminar examines people within organizations by exploring different levels of analysis, including individuals, groups, departments, organizations, industries, and societies. It focuses on better understanding how similar phenomena may operate at different levels, how phenomena at any one level are shaped by phenomena at other levels, and the reciprocal dynamics that exist between levels to make up the world of organizations in which we live and work. Meso organizational behaviour is important because: (a) it helps students of human resource management better understand the systemic factors that contribute to how individuals think, feel, and act in organizations; and (b) it helps students better understand how organizations are shaped by the people that populate them.

The primary aim is to introduce students to an understanding of how organizational scholars have conceptualized and studied organizations as systems of structures and relations and as cultural systems, and how these systems interact with and are embedded in the context of an external environment. To accomplish this aim the seminar focuses on some basic sociological tools for conceptually investigating a variety of organizational topics. Students acquire an in-depth understanding of how organizations are made up of formal, relational and cultural structures both inside and outside the organizational boundary. Some topics and conceptual frameworks include power, conflict, organizational identity and image, organizational control, discourse and rhetoric, legitimacy, organizational impression management, emergence of new organizations, and organizational change." ;

    dc:description " This course adopts the interactional framework of leadership, which considers that the leadership process is a function of three components: the leader, the followers, and the context. The course is structured to cover classic and emergent theories that address each of these components; though most theories focus on one of these three components, they also inform the other components in the model, either implicitly or explicitly. Implications for the practice of leadership are addressed through class discussions. An effort is made to ensure that students do not adopt a myopic view of leadership. Rather, different perspectives on the process of leadership are presented, that make radically different assumptions. Students are therefore required to identify these assumptions and develop well-articulated arguments that either support or refute these assumptions in order to develop a sophisticated view of leadership.

The impacts of national culture and national institutions of different countries on today’s global business environment are discussed as well. Specific areas such as internationalization of small and medium-sized enterprises, entry modes, international joint ventures, and management practices are covered.

Comparative corporate governance examines how institutions in different social and economic contexts influence this relationship and its consequences for the ownership, management, and strategic competitiveness of firms. In this seminar we address questions such as: How is corporate governance practised in different countries? Why are corporate governance practices similar or different across countries? Can we identify international best practices of corporate governance? To what extent are corporate governance best practices transferable across international contexts? How do different systems of corporate governance embody different economic, social, and political trade-offs among corporate stakeholders? We approach the questions from managerial, economic, legal, political, sociological and cultural perspectives. Using both conceptual and empirical studies, we also focus on a range of substantial issues, including corporate governance in family firms and in emerging market business groups.

The second stream focuses on core consulting skills, i.e. the skills required to operate and succeed as a management consultant. These skills are essential for any type of consulting engagement, whether one works as an external or internal consultant, and whether the client in a private sector, public, or non-profit organization. The third stream is a real world consulting project that students conduct in teams with a client firm in order to apply the tools and skills discussed in class.

The project involves working on a real-life supply chain management problem provided by a company. Once the problem is defined, the students prepare an overall project management plan to tackle the problem within a given time limit. The various stages of the project involve, among others: literature review, defining data and information requirements for problem analysis, gathering data, designing the appropriate model, conducting experimental design runs and sensitivity analyses, and presenting the solution(s) with an implementation plan. The project outcome is expected to have both academic and business merit. For projects done in groups of two students, there is a significant individual evaluation component in assessing the work done by each student." ;
