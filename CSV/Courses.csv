753,Applied Linear Statistical Models," The course focuses on systematic treatments of linear statistical models for regression, analysis of variance and experimental design with special emphasis on applications in business and economics. Topics include regression analysis: inference, model building, diagnostics, remedial measures and validation; single-factor and two-factor ANOVA models, and analysis of covariance. Other statistical tools for specialized applications discussed may include logistic regression, path analysis and time series regression. Case studies are employed to illustrate tools for fitting, checking, validating and interpreting linear models.",MSCA,602,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/jmsb/msc-ds-mis.html

The course is structured to cover classic and emergent theories that address each of these components; though most theories focus on one of these three components, they also inform the other components in the model, either implicitly or explicitly. Implications for the practice of leadership are addressed through class discussions. An effort is made to ensure that students do not adopt a myopic view of leadership. Rather, different perspectives on the process of leadership are presented, that make radically different assumptions. Students are therefore required to identify these assumptions and develop well-articulated arguments that either support or refute these assumptions in order to develop a sophisticated view of leadership.

1656,Applied Language Studies (3 credits)," This course examines the different theoretical concepts and methods used to analyze and describe the linguistic structure of language, and explores ways in which these can be applied to the teaching of second languages. The course introduces students to the key concepts that characterize the different components of language, namely phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics, within an approach that recognizes that languages can be affected by the social, psychological, and pragmatic aspects of human behaviour.",APLI,604,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/apli-ma.html
1657,Issues in Second Language Acquisition (3 credits)," Research in second language acquisition (SLA) is surveyed in this course. Students read, critique, and discuss a number of research reports and survey articles on topics including research techniques in SLA, individual differences believed to affect success in second language learning (e.g., age, motivation), the systematicity of learner language (interlanguage, developmental sequences), the influence of learners’ first language on the structure of their interlanguage, the development of general theories of SLA. The course concludes with a discussion of SLA research carried out in classroom settings.",APLI,621,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/apli-ma.html
1658,Research Methods I (3 credits)," The principal aims of the course are to enable students better to evaluate reports of empirical research in the language sciences and to plan limited studies of their own. Emphasis is placed upon the logic of research designs, the nature of scientific proof, and the assumptions underlying data analytic procedures. Case studies of published research, readings and lectures illustrate the concepts of data, scales, models, sampling, theory, description, estimation and significance testing.",APLI,660,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/apli-ma.html
1659,Sociolinguistic Aspects of Bilingualism and Multilingualism," This course is an introduction to educational and sociolinguistic issues affecting the promotion and maintenance of individual and societal bilingualism, multilingualism, and multiculturalism.

These competencies include building awareness of the client organization, supporting clients in making effective choices, developing agreements with clients that include the scope, schedule and budget of projects, managing project communications and changes throughout a project, and interacting effectively with clients. Note: Students who have received credit for ETEC 673 or for this topic under an ETEC 593/693 number may not take this course for credit.",ETEC,573,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/etec-dip.html
1889,Philosophical Issues in Educational Research," There are a number of important philosophical questions that lie behind the everyday practice of education research. The questions include: What does it mean to say that research in education is “scientific”? Is science (and, by extension, educational research) really value neutral and objective? What kinds of education research should count as legitimate? In the first part of the course, various definitions of science, for example, those of Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn, and some influential critiques of the scientific enterprise are examined. In the second part of the course, some of the ongoing debates about appropriate research methods in education are analyzed. Note: Students who have received credit for ADIP 501 or ESTU 601 or ETEC 607 may not take this course for credit.",ETEC,507,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/etec-dip.html

1907,Pro-Seminar I: Theory (3 credits)," This course is an advanced survey of literary theory, considering those thinkers whose work has been particularly influential for the discipline’s understanding of the nature and function of literature and its production. Figures to be studied may include Aristotle, Sidney, Nietzsche, Althusser, Lacan, Derrida, Barthes, Foucault, Deleuze, Irigaray, McLuhan, Badiou, Zizek, and Kristeva.",ENGL,800,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/engl-phd.html
1908,Pro-Seminar II: Methodology (3 credits)," This course considers literary research under the aegis of a current or emergent methodological paradigm in the field e.g. Book History, Media Studies, Digital Humanities, Poetics, Psychoanalysis, Affect Theory, or Neuroaesthetics.",ENGL,801,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/engl-phd.html
1909,Professional Development Workshops (1 credit)," The Department holds a series of workshops with the aim of introducing doctoral candidates to pertinent research, teaching, and professional expectations and enhancing career development. In order to graduate, all doctoral candidates must attend these workshops before the end of the sixth term. Master's students are also strongly encouraged to attend the relevant sessions since they are a constitutive component of graduate formation. If a student has attended a given workshop during his/her master's degree, he/she is exempted from that workshop. Workshops are led by faculty members and organized by the Graduate Program Director on a monthly basis in anticipation both of key dates during the PhD program (e.g. external grant application due dates) and the future professional life of the doctoral candidate (e.g. academic job interviews). The course is graded on a pass/fail basis.",ENGL,802,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/engl-phd.html
1910,Thesis Proposal (6 credits), Students are admitted to candidacy for the PhD upon acceptance by their advisory committee of the written thesis proposal and its successful defence. The oral examination of the written thesis proposal normally takes place in the term following the writing of the field examinations.,ENGL,890,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/engl-phd.html
1911,The Major Field Examination I (6 credits)," This course focuses broadly on the candidate’s primary area of specialization, covering major authors, genres, and issues and the pertinent canonical texts therein, in order to consolidate the necessary background knowledge for advanced literary research and teaching at the university level. In the examination, candidates are expected to demonstrate comprehensive knowledge of the designated field as well as an original, critical understanding of the field and its constitutive texts. The Department has established reading lists in nine broad areas of specialization that cover a variety of periods, nations, and subjects. These basic lists may be modified to suit the interests of individual candidates. A substitution of 20 per cent is permitted for all reading lists for the purposes of tailoring the lists to the interests of the student. Such substitutions are to be determined by agreement between the student and the student's supervisor and are subject to approval by the Graduate Program Committee.",ENGL,891,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/engl-phd.html
1912,The Sub-Field Examination II (6 credits)," This course is designed to cultivate a more specific area of inquiry that may include a body of literary texts in combination with readings in a particular set of methodological or theoretical problems to the end of developing a viable doctoral topic and composing a thesis proposal. The Sub-Field Examination list is established by the candidate in consultation with the doctoral supervisor and comprises approximately 60 items that are seen as directly relevant to the field in which the dissertation is oriented. It is divided into three sections: 1) approximately 20 literary texts; 2) approximately 20 theoretical/methodological texts; 3) approximately 20 texts drawn from adjacent and/or ancillary fields. By “text,” it means the number of poems or articles deemed by field specialists as sufficiently representative of an author's work or period. A text cannot appear twice on any of the lists, including that of the Major Field. The lists and texts are not exhaustive, but are meant to provide the student with the necessary initiation to sub-fields that help to clarify the direction and goals of the dissertation.",ENGL,892,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/engl-phd.html
1913,Thesis Research (53 credits), Doctoral students must submit a thesis based on their research and defend it in an oral examination.,ENGL,895,http://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/engl-phd.html
